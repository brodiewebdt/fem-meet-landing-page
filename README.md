## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is a redo of this challenge. I combined the two desktop images to create the single image for tablet and mobile. I also changed the button text colors and hover states to pass accessibility contrast checks.

### Continued development

I wasn't able to get the images to overflow the page view. I will need to spend more time on this to figure out how to do it.
